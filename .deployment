# Disable Oryx build process (we build in CI/CD)
# But allow dependency installation during deployment
SCM_DO_BUILD_DURING_DEPLOYMENT=true
ENABLE_ORYX_BUILD=false

# Note: SCM_DO_BUILD_DURING_DEPLOYMENT=true allows Azure to install dependencies
# from requirements.txt during deployment, but ENABLE_ORYX_BUILD=false prevents
# the full build process. This gives us dependency installation without Oryx build.
